The repository contains the two basic searching algorithms, i.e. linear searching algorithm &amp; binary searching algorithm.

## Linear Search

Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
